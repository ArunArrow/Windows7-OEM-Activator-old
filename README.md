# Windows-7-OEM-Activator (FOG Project Edition)
This is a batch script for activating Windows 7 using an OEM certificate. For computers that come with a Windows 8/10 sticker but have downgrade rights to Windows 7 this allows you activate it after doing a clean install of Windows 7.

You can also use it to install a retail or volume license key. 

# Main Features

- Unattended mode (detect manufacturer and auto-install matching certificate/key) ✔
- Multiple edition support (Starter, Home Prem/Basic and Ultimate) ✔
- Detect incompatible Windows versions or editions ✔
- Autodetect failed activation and try alternate ✔

# Usage:

2. Double click Win7-OEM-Activator.bat

# Switches

`UNATTEND` - Requires no user interaction. Be sure to check the log file if something didn't work, because the script will exit automatically.
