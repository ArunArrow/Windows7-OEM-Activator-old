# Windows-7-Activator (dev branch)
This is a batch script for activating Windows 7 using an OEM certificate. For computers that come with a Windows 8/10 sticker but have downgrade rights to Windows 7 Pro. This allows you activate it after doing a clean install. It's useful in conjunction with SetupComplete.cmd if you're setting up a Windows 7 deployment image.

You can also use it to install a retail or volume license key. 

# Roadmap

The following features are being developed for the script:

- Multiple edition support (Home Premium, Basic and Ultimate)
- Autodetect failed activation and alternative certificate attempt
- Eventually will be ported over to Powershell or VB.

Please suggest any features you'd like to see.
